### Goal of the test
Goal of this exercise is to create a small web application that visualizes database data.
Frontend should allow to:
- Filter to display all groups with a given style.
- Filter to display all groups from a given country.
- Sort groups by year with one or both filters applied.
- Default sort should be by alphabetical order of name.


### Instructions
- [ ] Frontend must be written using React, backend/data access is up to you. Feel free to use libraries/tools you want.
- [ ] Fork this repository
- [ ] Implement the required feature
- [ ] Publish it on GitHub as a pull-request
- [ ] Send us the link and tell us approximatively how much time you spent on this assignment


WHATEVER HAPPENS, DON'T SPEND MORE THAN 2H ON THE EXERCISE. ALSO, DON'T WRITE DOCUMENTATION, WE WILL DISCUSS EVERYTHING LIVE.

It's ok if it is not finished, it's ok if you could have done better with more time. We will
discuss together about your code, your choices etc.
